            An atom is the smallest constituent unit of ordinary matter that has the properties of a
            chemical element. Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized
            atoms. Atoms are very small; typical sizes are around 100 picometers (a ten-billionth of a
            meter, in the short scale).
